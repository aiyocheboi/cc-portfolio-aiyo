          Reflection - The Hardest Face Generator
        </h1>

        
        <p>
          This face generator is a rudimentary attempt. I spent a few hours trying to do something more complex, but was starting to confuse basic principles. I submitted a sketch that is not a full representation of what I would like it to be, however, I was able to get some of the functions to work. 
          This is a process of learning to be gentle with myself. </p>
          
        <p><b>~A revision from the future~</b></p>
          <p>After rereading what I wrote, I want to show myself more tenderness. I think that what I created has an element of glitch that runs throughout my work. I think that glitch works very well and embodies the stress I felt when initially doing this experiment. 
While working in groups, I learned how to set my background to random. Learning how to apply this made me happy because my sketch became more interactive. 

I do want to revisit this experiment and create what I initially set out to sketch.

          My initial feeling toward this sketch felt choppy and like I did not understand what I was doing. 
          The effect that I acheieved in this sketch I am reminded of the show Daria. There was a teacher on that show that had an eye that always got really big and twitched a lot. I felt really stressed the week that I created this sketch
          and definitely feel like the anxiety is illustrated. I also used mouseClick to change the background rapidly to show that the various changing scenes can produce the anxiety effect.

        <p>
          This design was an attempt to try to create something within the time constraints. I am learning how to structure time.

          When it is time to revise, I think that I will try my initial sketch because it speaks to my spirit and I feel more confident in trying to execute it.
