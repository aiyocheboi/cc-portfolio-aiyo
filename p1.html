        <p>
          When I received the project description, I immediately thought of a
          Tamagotchi! I grew up as a 90’s kid, and I remember these toys being
          around all the time. The description fit the schema of a Tamagotchi,
          so I decided to investigate this idea. I looked at reference photos of
          Tamagotchis online to get a general idea of the shape, size, buttons,
          and screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was my first time using P5js, so I followed Xin’s video of the
          smiley face tutorial. I felt that I had a decent understanding of
          ellipses and circles, so I decided to start creating the body of this
          toy. I initially made the body a teal color, but after using the
          Multiply function in blendMode, I changed the color to its current
          purple hue so that the buttons could stand out. I wanted the image to
          have depth, so I created a background for the screen to sit on. I
          wanted to create a character to go inside the screen, so I researched
          past versions of the original Tamagotchi creatures. I made a creature
          that feels a bit more modern (to me) than the original 8-bit
          characters while also playing with 2D Primitives.
        </p>

        <p>
          I created a creature with a shocked expression because I felt after
          trying to make the Zig Zag lines around the screen. I was shocked by
          the difficulty of what felt like simple lines. I tried many times to
          create a frame using lines, triangles, and custom shapes in P5js, but
          could not create anything that made an entire frame around the screen.
          I did not want to give up, so I tried for many days but kept hitting a
          wall because I have little knowledge of this program at this time. I
          want to return to this project once I understand P5js and create a Zig
          Zag frame around the screen. I also want to add life to the design by
          giving the body more texture and highlighting to indicate light
          hitting it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Overall, my reflection of my process in this project is positive. I
          had to get out of the mindset that what I create now is finite because
          I know that there will be more opportunities to tweak my code and
          design soon. I definitely understant that this project was not
          "successfully" created because I missed a major portion of the design
          brief. After watching the tutorials, I understand coding (a bit)
          better, but I want to explore the relationship between angles and
          lines within the design plane. It may help to sketch things out by
          hand going forward so that it doesn’t feel like a guessing game.

         After I completed the first sketch, I immediately wanted to remake it. I stayed up a whole night to recreate this. I decided to approach the zig-zag screens as triangles that could be applied as stickers to give it that effect. I think that that helped me get out of my head and not think as literally. I found more joy in making the second prototype of this sketch. </b><p>
