          A soul's journey is a game about Aiyo's soul traveling through the 
          cosmos and connecting with ancestors. This game is intended to 
          invite the player to breathe and flow with the soul. There are no 
          set of rules, scores, and you cannot "lose".

          Design Process
        </h1>
          <p>
            My design process originally began with a series of 3 mazes - the character was a little black mouse navigating through. I created a graybox and as time passed this game started to feel so confining. 
          So, I changed my game. I changed the game the Friday before it was due and felt a twinge of uncertainty for a second. However, I practiced 
            grouning myself each day after as I wrote the code. As I was coding I took Elizabeth's advice to break the code into parts so that it is 
            easier to see what is working. I coded for a few days straight and used the book "Make: Getting Started with p5.js - Making Interactive Graphics in JavaScript and 
          Processing" a lot while crafting this code.</p>
          <p>
            When creating "a soul's journey" I was inspired by tarot cards and wanted to craft a story around "The Hermit" and "The Tower" cards. 
          "The Hermit" card symbolizes "The Hermit suggests that you are in a phase of introspection where you are drawing your attention inwards and looking for answers within. You are in need of a period of inner reflection, away from the current demands of your position."
          "The Tower" card symbolizes "The Tower is commonly interpreted as meaning danger, crisis, destruction, and liberation. It is associated with sudden unforeseen change."
          (Definitions pulled from Google).
            
            I have pulled these cards during (Tarot) Readings in the past and I originally wanted to explore
        how a soul's essence could be captured by recreating these cards. Trying to tie in the tarot deck felt like it was taking too 
            much time because I was still so far from the design requirements. I spent a lot of time making the Hermit card to realize that it 
            did not fit into this narrative. So, I left that to be a project to explore in the future. 
           </p>
          
          <p>
            I then abstracted "The Tower" tarot card and returned to an orginal idea that I had when originallty sketching out the maze 
            game. I wanted to create a path (that used keyboard inteactions) in which the main character could not escape. I drafted out the
            "Field of Visions" and incorported Bezier Curve which I was orginally afraid to use, but had a really pleasant time incoporating. 
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I created the Soundscape for this game through Lofi music collected from SoundCloud and recorded audio clips of myself. I wanted to create a Narrator that gentlely 
            guides a player through this experience. I wanted to abstract how game play could be explored/experienced, so I incorporated breath-work 
            and consent for the "player" to engage with. I created the Soundscape in Adobe Audition. 
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <b>Reflection:</b>
            This game was really challenging to make and I appreciate the challenge. There were many moments where I wanted to give up, but I 
            asked myself what I am here to create and that helped ground me and help me move forward. Even when things felt difficult. I am 
            greateful to be developing a process and being gentle with my progress.
