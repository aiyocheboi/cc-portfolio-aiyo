      <h2>
        <p>A corpse on an interstellar journey. This character has travelled from the near future to communicate with the current lifeforms on Earth.</p> <p> In their past life they were a blue jay named Derrick. Derrick was a free-spirited blue jay that liked to play soothing jazz in the evenings from precisely 6pm-7:05pm. Derrick was playing sweet soothing tunes one evening on a gentle fall night. The rain was falling so sweetly and Derrick was in a trance with their soothing jams blasting around the room. As the clock neared 7:04pm, Derrick was wiping the tears from their eyes as they played their final notes. Notes that would soon open a portal to a new world...</p>
        
        <p>We've caught up with Derrick in the present. Their form has merged with a spirit guide and a wanderer.</p>
        <p>Derrick is discovering a new mission in this new timeline. They have magic hands that heal and special shoes that carry their new life form through the cosmos.</p>

        I was thinking about birds when I started this sketch. I wanted this sweet bird to wear a little sweater. At the end of this drawing I was thinking about Narwhals. I created this design by using 2D Primitives that felt easy to adapt.
        I also approached this project by importing the image of both Nina's and Smitha's corpses. I wanted to see if I could manipulate an image (like how we did with the class coloring book). I found this to be very 
        fun because I was able to play with quads and I have not used those in my designs before. I also loved assembling this character by keeping it very close to its orginal drawing. It reminded be of creating the essence of a drawing.

      <p>
        I crafted this sketch after letting my body take a break. I want to reflect on incorporating care 
        into my practice. I was a bit worried about intially turning in this assignment late, but I realized 
        that I must be gentle with myself as I craft this practice.
