      <h2>
        <p>I am interested in the intersection between memories and how memories are stored/encoded. After learning about
        the connection between code and weaving I wanted to create a digitally "woven patter". I embedded the following phrases from conversations with pat, john, and my mom:</p>
        <p>"if I had listened to the flesh, I would have been gone"</p> 
        <p>
          "what does it mean that I am still here?"
        </p>
        <p>
          
        "it's the answer that you already know but don't want to say"
        </p>

        Reflecting on patterns that may have been passed down from my family left me searching for a connection to this project
        for a few days. I often feel like I'm floating in the cosmos, trying to catch tradition and ritual as fast as 
        my hands can create them. I have been working through this idea of Un/burdening the soul as it relates to black bodies in digital space. I am curious about the path where we cross over and TRANScend into the digital realm. I 
        am curious about so much. So, in this design I reflected upon what else could be passed down and 'materialized' in a way. I created a sketch of squiggly shapes that never touch.
        I often make these drawings when I feel really anxious and have been making these patterns over the 
        past few years. I took some phrases from a conversation that I had with people that I have formed bonds with. I wanted to weave the phrases into the piece and keep them 
        hidden. I thought about how Burdens can be buried or embedded in the body.

      <p>
        I reflected on how anxiety can be passed down and wanted to explore how that would look as a pattern. I wanted the design to be light because the anxious 
        squiggles add so much weight to the scene. I wanted my lines to look like threads or stitching.

      I borrowed '008_image-loop-grid' by joeyklee <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/joeyklee/sketches/SkjS8AFYX">joey k lee's sketch of how to make a grid of images in P5Js</a> to learn how to make the background with a single image.
