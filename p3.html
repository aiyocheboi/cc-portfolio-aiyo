      <h1>
        <p>A space where time is only reflected in milliseconds. Each interval should be marking the passage of seconds. 
          This experiment was originally based on time keeping based on the moon cycles ðŸŒ•ðŸŒ— 
          
          I wanted to imagine a timeline where hours, minutes, and seconds are abstracted. The hours are hours in cube like structures in the core of the cosmic body. The cosmic body is a visual embodiment of minutes. The seconds are free to roam around the cosmic body. The seconds also represent a rotating moon cycle where we see the moon in two stages : full and harvest (or blood moon)

        I wanted to create a sphere that was rotating so I found
        a youTube tutorial by Colorful Coding. 
        I followed the tutorial to understand how to create a 
        sphere that rotates. I borrowed their application of a 
        rotating sphere and the way they mapped out colors.

        I am really happy with how this design turned out. The sketches show what
        I created after watching the tutorial. After that, the code broke twice -_-
        So, I took my time to work through Xin and Katherine's videos to understand the 
        functions that I saw in the tutorial. I was able to adapt what I saw and create
        something that resonated with me more. I enjoyed the challenge of trying to 
        reconstruct a process that I want to imitate, but taking the time to leave 
        traces of my personality in the code. I am starting to see how we are weaving our 
        sould into each trace of code we construct.

    I used Xin Xin and Katherine's tutorials as a guide. 
  This sphere came from a tutorial from <a href="https://youtu.be/2jBPH--Boe4">Colorful Coding.</a>
